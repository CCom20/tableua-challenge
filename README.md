### Customers vs. Subscribers

**Observations**

Fridays and Saturdays look to be peak days in terms of total usage. There's steady growth throughout the week for Subscribers with a peak on Saturday for both user types. Mondays see an increase for Subscribers also, likely due to work commutes. The weekend trends could be attributed to typical weekend activities.

Top starting points also look to be close to subways, perhaps indicating that bikes are used in conjunction with subway travel. 

### Most Common Routes

**Observations**

Both Newport and Liberty have the same start and end locations. This could be caused by people who use the bike as a means for transportation then later return it to the same location. 

Sip Ave. is next to a transportation station, and McGinely Square is near a courthouse. Perhaps people use the subway for their longer trips, and the bikes provide a quick means over a shorter distance.
